# Student-message-transfer-line
A list of 30 students (read from names.txt) passes a user-given message in a chosen direction (left or right). The message moves until it reaches a randomly chosen hub student or the listâ€™s border. At a hub, the user inputs a new message, and the direction reverses. Each student can pass the message to another student within 1-5 positions away.
